## ðŸ§© AwesomeOS: a custom OS prototype

**Solo-developed systems architecture prototype** This was my attempt at trying to get familiar with assembly to showcase my skills.
Assembly is a very oold langauge and works different than any other programming langauge. Syntax is different and it requires a vast
knowledge of bits and byte addresses. Due to this fact it is not widely used these days and because of that chatGPT does not know it
well enough that I can reliably use Ai to learn assembly fast. Because of this this project was put on hold.

## ðŸ”® Future Plans
  - Write the bootloader in assembly
  - Write a kernel in assembly and C
  - Design a modern UI and wrap it around the kernel

## ðŸ§  Developer Notes

  While the project was failure and requires more knowledge than I can feasibly accumulate ina  week I did get a feel for assembly in
  general and learned a lot about operating systems and how they work.
